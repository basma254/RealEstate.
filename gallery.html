                                 <p>Beer is the world's oldest[1][2][3] and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drink;
                                    it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The
                                    production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of sugars,
                                    mainly derived
                                    from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat,
                                    maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops,
                                    which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings
                                    such as
                                    herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a
                                    natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and
                                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings
                                    refer
                                    to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws
                                    regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
                                    Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
                                    remembering
                                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10]</p>

                                 <p>A vine (Latin vīnea "grapevine", "vineyard", from vīnum "wine") in the narrowest
                                    sense is the grapevine (Vitis), but more generally it can refer to any plant with
                                    a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or
                                    runners.
                                    The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when
                                    used in wicker work.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the term "vine" applies almost
                                    exclusively to the grapevine. The term "climber" is used for all climbing
                                    plants.[3]</p>

                                    distinct types: cloudy and clear; each is known simply as "lemonade" (or a

                                    where dominant.[1] Cloudy lemonade, generally found in North America and India,
                                    is a traditionally homemade drink made with lemon juice, water, and sweetener
                                    such as cane sugar or honey.[2] Found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South
                                    Africa, Australia,
                                    and New Zealand, clear lemonade is a lemon flavoured carbonated soft drink. Not
                                    to be confused with Sprite a lemon-lime flavored, soft drink.</p>

                                 <p>Beer is the world's oldest[1][2][3] and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drink;
                                    it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The
                                    production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of sugars,
                                    mainly derived
                                    from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat,
                                    maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops,
                                    which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings
                                    such as
                                    herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a
                                    natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and
                                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings
                                    refer
                                    to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws
                                    regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
                                    Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
                                    remembering
                                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10]</p>

                                 <p>Beer is the world's oldest[1][2][3] and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drink;
                                    it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The
                                    production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of sugars,
                                    mainly derived
                                    from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat,
                                    maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops,
                                    which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings
                                    such as
                                    herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a
                                    natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and
                                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings
                                    refer
                                    to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws
                                    regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
                                    Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
                                    remembering
                                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10]</p>

                                 <p>Beer is the world's oldest[1][2][3] and most widely consumed[4] alcoholic drink;
                                    it is the third most popular drink overall, after water and tea.[5] The
                                    production of beer is called brewing, which involves the fermentation of sugars,
                                    mainly derived
                                    from cereal grain starches—most commonly from malted barley, although wheat,
                                    maize (corn), and rice are widely used.[6] Most beer is flavoured with hops,
                                    which add bitterness and act as a natural preservative, though other flavourings
                                    such as
                                    herbs or fruit may occasionally be included. The fermentation process causes a
                                    natural carbonation effect, although this is often removed during processing, and
                                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings
                                    refer
                                    to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws
                                    regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
                                    Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
                                    remembering
                                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10]</p>

                                    used in wicker work.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the term "vine" applies almost

                                    replaced with forced carbonation.[7] Some of humanity's earliest known writings
                                    refer
                                    to the production and distribution of beer: the Code of Hammurabi included laws
                                    regulating beer and beer parlours,[8] and "The Hymn to Ninkasi", a prayer to the
                                    Mesopotamian goddess of beer, served as both a prayer and as a method of
                                    remembering
                                    the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people.[9][10]</p>

                                 <p>A vine (Latin vīnea "grapevine", "vineyard", from vīnum "wine") in the narrowest
                                    sense is the grapevine (Vitis), but more generally it can refer to any plant with
                                    a growth habit of trailing or scandent (that is, climbing) stems, lianas or
                                    runners.
                                    The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when
                                    used in wicker work.[1][2] In the United Kingdom, the term "vine" applies almost
                                    exclusively to the grapevine. The term "climber" is used for all climbing
                                    plants.[3]</p>

                                    characterized by lemon flavor. Most lemonade varieties can be separated into two
                                    distinct types: cloudy and clear; each is known simply as "lemonade" (or a
                                    cognate) in countries
                                    where dominant.[1] Cloudy lemonade, generally found in North America and India,
                                    is a traditionally homemade drink made with lemon juice, water, and sweetener
                                    such as cane sugar or honey.[2] Found in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South
                                    Africa, Australia,
                                    and New Zealand, clear lemonade is a lemon flavoured carbonated soft drink. Not
                                    to be confused with Sprite a lemon-lime flavored, soft drink.</p>
